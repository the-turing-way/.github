# Code of Conduct

We value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure that every contributor has an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.
Accordingly, everyone who participates in *The Turing Way* project is expected to show respect and courtesy to other community members at all times.

*The Turing Way* project leaders, Dr. Kirstie Whitaker and Dr. Malvika Sharan are dedicated to a ***welcoming and harassment-free experience for everyone***, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. 
**We do not tolerate harassment by and/or of members of our community in any form**.

We are particularly motivated to support new and/or anxious collaborators, people who are looking to learn and develop their skills, and anyone who has experienced discrimination in the past.

To make clear what is expected, we ask all members of the community to conform to the following Code of Conduct.

The Code of Conduct document has been written in 4 parts: Overview, Details, Reporting and Enforcement.

The last part acknowledges all sources that this Code of Conduct has been built upon.

## 1 Code of Conduct: Overview

*The Turing Way* is a community-oriented and community-led project.
We value the involvement of everyone in the community.
We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing.
All participants in our in-person events and online communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others at all times.

To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in activities associated with *The Turing Way* project is required to conform to this Code of Conduct.
This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by *The Turing Way* project including, but not limited to, in-person focus groups and workshops, and communications online via GitHub.

### Contact for Reporting

The co-lead-investigators of *The Turing Way* - Dr. Kirstie Whitaker ([kwhitaker@turing.ac.uk](mailto:kwhitaker@turing.ac.uk)) and Dr. Malvika Sharan ([msharan@turing.ac.uk](mailto:msharan@turing.ac.uk)) - are responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct.

If you prefer not to contact the project leads, you may also contact [Anna Krystalli](mailto:a.krystalli@sheffield.ac.uk), who is our ombudsperson.

Together they form the current Code of Conduct committee.

You can reach out to our Research Community Manager, Anne Lee Steele ([asteele@turing.ac.uk](mailto:asteele@turing.ac.uk)) and Research Project Manager, Alexandra Araujo Alvarez ([aaraujo.alvarez@turing.ac.uk](mailto:aaraujo.alvarez@turing.ac.uk)) for support in making a report to the project leads on your behalf, with or without your name associated with it.

Reports may be reviewed by other members of the core development team, unless there is a conflict of interest, and will be kept confidential.

# 2 Code of Conduct: Details

*The Turing Way* team are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity.
As such, we do not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful to our community members or that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others.
We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to: gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience level.

Everyone who participates in *The Turing Way* project activities is required to conform to this Code of Conduct.
This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by *The Turing Way* project including, but not limited to, in-person focus groups and workshops, and communications online via GitHub.
By participating, contributors indicate their acceptance of the procedures by which *The Turing Way* project core development team resolves any Code of Conduct incidents, which may include the storage and processing of their personal information.

## 2.1 Expected Behaviour

We are confident that our community members will build a supportive and collaborative atmosphere at our events and during online communications.
The following bullet points set out explicitly what we hope you will consider to be appropriate community guidelines:

* **Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences**. Do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ageist, ableist, sexist, or otherwise exclusionary behaviour.
* **Use welcoming and inclusive language**. Exclusionary comments or jokes, threats or violent language are not acceptable. Do not address others in an angry, intimidating, or demeaning manner. Be considerate of the ways the words you choose may impact others. Be patient and respectful of the fact that English is a second (or third or fourth!) language for some participants.
* **Do not harass people**. Harassment includes unwanted physical contact, sexual attention, or repeated social contact. Know that consent is explicit, conscious and continuous—not implied. If you are unsure whether your behaviour towards another person is welcome, ask them. If someone tells you to stop, do so.
* **Respect the privacy and safety of others**. Do not take photographs of others without their permission. Do not share other participants’ personal experiences without their express permission. Note that posting (or threatening to post) personally identifying information of others without their consent ("doxing") is a form of harassment.
* **Be considerate of others’ participation**. Everyone should have an opportunity to be heard. In update sessions, please keep comments succinct so as to allow maximum engagement by all participants. Do not interrupt others on the basis of disagreement; hold such comments until they have finished speaking.
* **Don’t be a bystander**. If you see something inappropriate happening, speak up. If you don't feel comfortable intervening but feel someone should, please feel free to ask a member of the Code of Conduct response team for support.
* As an overriding general rule, please **be intentional in your actions and humble in your mistakes**.

All interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person.
See [this explanation of the four social rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) - no feigning surprise, no 'well-actually', no back-seat driving, no subtle -isms - for further recommendations for inclusive behaviours.

## 2.2 Unacceptable Behaviour

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by Turing Way community members at any project event or platform include:

* written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership in any specific group
* causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation
* violent threats or language directed against another person
* display of sexual or violent images
* unwelcome sexual attention
* nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
* sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
* insults or put-downs
* sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
* excessive swearing
* incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
* continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop
* publication of private communication without consent

## 2.3 Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviour

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately.
This applies to all Turing Way community events and platforms, either online or in-person.
If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this Code of Conduct, any member of the core development team may warn the offender, ask them to leave the event or platform (without refund), or impose any other appropriate sanctions (see the [enforcement manual](#4-enforcement-manual) for details).

## 2.4 Feedback

This Code of Conduct is not intended as a static set of rules by which everyone must abide.
Rather, you are invited to make suggestions for updates or clarifications by contacting *The Turing Way* Core Staff Team at [turingway@turing.ac.uk](mailto:turingway@turing.ac.uk) or by making a pull request to this document on GitHub.

# 3 Incident Reporting Guidelines

## 3.1 Contact points

If you feel able to, please contact Dr. Kirstie Whitaker ([kwhitaker@turing.ac.uk](mailto:kwhitaker@turing.ac.uk)) and Dr. Malvika Sharan ([msharan@turing.ac.uk](mailto:msharan@turing.ac.uk)) - who are responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct.

## 3.2 Alternate contact points

If you prefer not to contact the project leads, you may also contact [Anna Krystalli](mailto:annakrystalli@googlemail.com), who is our ombudsperson.

You can reach out to our Research Community Manager, Anne Lee Steele ([asteele@turing.ac.uk](mailto:asteele@turing.ac.uk)) and Research Project Manager, Alexandra Araujo Alvarez ([aaraujo.alvarez@turing.ac.uk](mailto:aaraujo.alvarez@turing.ac.uk)) for support in making a report to the project leads on your behalf or anonymously.

## 3.3 What to do if someone is in physical danger

If you believe someone is in physical danger, please contact the appropriate emergency responders.

## 3.4 Report handling 

A detailed report handling policy is available in the Report Handling Manual in section 4.

## 3.5 Code of Conduct Enforcement

A detailed enforcement policy is available in the Enforcement Manual in section 5.

## 3.6 Terminology Used in Report Handling and Enforcement Manuals

* Reporter: Person reporting an incident.
* Reportee: Person being reported.

## 4 Report Handling Manual

After receiving a report, the committee will review the incident report and follow the policies 
described in this Report Handling Manual.
Using the report handling and enforcement process described in this document, the committee will handle the Code of Conduct and take further actions.

### 4.1 If the Report is considered within the scope of this Code of Conduct

The committee will reach out to the reporter to ask for further information if the 
the submitted report is not complete or needs some additional context.
The committee will also ensure that the person impacted or harmed by the incident report
is safe and identifies how they can be further supported.

**4.1.1** When the committee decides to meet the reportee, these questions will be used to guide the meeting:
- What happened?
- What were you thinking at the time?
- Who has been affected by what you have done? In what way?
- What do you think you need to do to make things right?
- Knowing what you know, what would you have done differently?

**4.1.2** When the incident in question inflicted harm on another person, additional 
questions will be asked on behalf of the person(s) harmed:
- What did you think when you realized what had happened?
- What impact has this incident had on you and others?
- What has been the hardest thing for you?
- What do you think needs to happen to make things right?

The committee may follow up with reportee or reporter after this discussion 
with any additional questions to help them reach a resolution and must note feedback for the record.

Mediating interaction or communication between reporter and reportee 
is not in the scope of this Code of Conduct.

### 4.2 If the breach is considered outside the scope of this Code of Conduct


An internal resolution will be agreed upon using the Enforcement Manual, 
taking the following two objectives into account:
1. provide support for the reporter and the person(s) harmed, and
2. plan the continued participation of the reportee as per the Enforcement Manual.

Due to the severity of the incident reports that go beyond norm-setting in *The Turing Way*, an appropriate 
(external) authority such as the reportee's employee/line manager will be identified
who can respond to the incident report with the appropriate action.
The report will be passed to the identified authority with an agreement to receive an update from their enforcement process.

The resolution or decision made by the external authority may or may not have an impact on the internal resolution.

A transparency report will be drafted by the committee and shared with the community where appropriate.

### 4.3 If the report is considered outside the scope of this Code of Conduct and the reportee is an employee of the Turing

The Code of Conduct should be considered a norm-setting mechanism for all community members, including the Turing employees.
For all incident reports that are considered beyond the scope of this Code of Conduct, **the Turing Institute's employment policies will apply**.

The committee will **escalate the issue to Kirstie Whitaker** (if not already involved), 
who is ** project lead and Director of the Tools, Practices and Systems Research Programme at the Turing.
She will share the report and committee's recommendations with the line manager of the reportee, 
who will be responsible for taking disciplinary action, such as starting an HR process, formally or informally.

The line manager will follow the Turing policies and [the Turing's Code of Conduct policy](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/Interact/Pages/Content/Document.aspx?id=2174&SearchId=0&utm_source=interact&utm_medium=category_search&utm_term=*), as well as enforcement mechanism, will take precedence over this Code of Conduct enforcement.

All the Turing employees have the obligation to read and understand the [HR/People policies](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/Interact/Pages/Section/ContentListing.aspx?subsection=3439&utm_source=interact&utm_medium=general_search&utm_term=HR+policies), which include, but not limited to:

# 5 Enforcement Manual

This is the enforcement manual used by the Code of Conduct Committee when they respond to an issue to make sure they are consistent and fair.
Enforcement of the Code of Conduct should be respectful and not include any harassing behaviours.

## 5.1 Urgent Situations: Acting Unilaterally

If the incident involves physical danger or involves a threat to anyone's safety (such as threats of violence), any member of the community may -- and should -- act unilaterally to protect the safety of any community member.
This can include contacting law enforcement (or other local personnel) and speaking on behalf of *The Turing Way* team.

If the act is ongoing, any community member may act immediately, before reaching a consensus, to diffuse the situation.
In ongoing situations, any member may at their discretion employ any of the tools available in this enforcement manual, including bans and blocks online, or removal from a physical space.

In situations where an individual community member acts unilaterally, they must inform the committee as soon as possible, and report their actions for review within 24 hours.

## 5.2 Less-Urgent Situations

Upon receiving a report of an incident, the Code of Conduct committee will review the incident and determine, to the best of their ability:

- whether this is an ongoing situation
- whether there is a threat to anyone's physical safety
- what happened
- whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation
- who, if anyone, was the bad actor

This information will be collected either in person or in writing.
The Code of Conduct committee will provide a written summary of the information surrounding the incident.
All participants will be anonymised in the summary report, referred to as "Community Member 1", "Community Member 2", or "Research Team Member 1".
The "de-anonymising key" will be kept in a separate file and only accessed to link repeated reports against the same person over time.

The Code of Conduct committee will aim to have a resolution agreed upon within one week.
In the event that a resolution can't be determined in that time, a member of the Code of Conduct committee will respond to the reporter(s) with an update and projected timeline for resolution.

## 5.4 Resolutions

The Code of Conduct committee will seek to agree on a resolution by consensus of all members investigating the report in question.
If the committee cannot reach a consensus and deadlocks for over a week, Kirstie Whitaker will break the tie.
If any of the committee members are unable to take part in the discussion due to a conflict of interest, Anna Krystalli, as an external member of the Code of Conduct committee, will make the decision.

Possible responses may include:

* A mediated conversation or agreement between the impacted community members.
* A request for a verbal or written apology, public or private, from a community member.
* A public announcement clarifying community responsibilities under the Code of Conduct.
* Nothing, if the issue reported is not a violation or outside of the scope of this Code of Conduct.
* A private in-person conversation between a member of the committee and the individual(s) involved.
  In this case, the person who has the conversation will provide a written summary for record keeping.
* A private written reprimand from a member of the committee to the individual(s) involved.
  In this case, the committee member will deliver that reprimand to the individual(s) over email, cc'ing Kirstie Whitaker for record keeping.
* A public announcement of an incident, ideally in the same venue that the violation occurred (such as on the listserv for a listserv violation; and GitHub for a GitHub violation).
  The committee may choose to publish this message elsewhere for posterity.
* An imposed "time out" from online spaces.
  Committee members will communicate this "time out" to the individual(s) involved.
* A permanent or temporary ban from some or all Turing Way project spaces (like on GitHub, online calls or in-person events).
  The committee will maintain records of all such bans so that they may be reviewed in the future, extended to a Code of Conduct safety team as it is built, or otherwise maintained.
  If a member of the community is removed from an event they will not be reimbursed for any part of the event that they miss.

Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, a member of the Code of Conduct committee will contact the original reporter and any other affected parties and explain the proposed resolution.
The Code of Conduct committee member will ask if this resolution is acceptable, and must note feedback for the record.
However, the Code of Conduct committee is not required to act on this feedback.

## 6 Conflict of Interest 

If the report is about someone is the committee, please send the report to the other individuals on the committee.

If a committee member identifies their link with a reporter or reportee that may affect their participation 
in the ongoing issue (such as introducing personal bias or impacting their well-being), they will declare their 
Conflict of Interest and remove themselves from any discussion related to the report handling.

All reports will be kept confidential with details shared only with the people involved in the 
report handling and enforcement.
